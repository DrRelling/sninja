# sninja
ServiceNow Ninja Menu

This is a fork of the original sninja which works with the latest versions of ServiceNow and has a few extra features. All the hard work was done by salacosta, I just tweaked it a little.

## Installation

1. Load Update Set
2. Create a User Preference `sninja.run` and set the value to `true` for users.
3. Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
4. Press the backtick ` button to load the Search Bar
5. Start typing to load autocomplete values

## New Features

* Press ` again to cycle between opening the selection in the current or new tab/window.
* Press the space key before typing to cycle between searching the navigator, your bookmarks and your history.
